# portScanner
Port Scanner Created with Python

This is a Port Scanning project I worked on using PyCharm's IDE.

A Port Scanner is an application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. Such an application may be used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify network services running on a host and exploit vulnerabilities.

This scanner scans port 80 (HTTP; Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and port 22 (SSH; Secure Shell) on Google's servers.
